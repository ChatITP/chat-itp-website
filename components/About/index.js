        We are training an ethical, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) using 20+ years of
        student work from the International Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch. Our goal
        is to reflect the creative legacy of the ITP community with a model that can reflect on the
        history of student work, participate in classes, and generate new work based on the creative
        consciousness of ITP.
