        We are training an ethical, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) using
        20+ years of student work from the International Telecommunications
        Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch. Our goal is to reflect the creative legacy
        of the ITP community with a model that can reflect on the history of
        student work, participate in classes, and generate new work based on the
        creative consciousness of ITP.
